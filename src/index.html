        "I am not afraid... I was born to do this.
If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me.
Of the love or hatred God has for the English, I know nothing, but I do know that they will all be thrown out of France, except those who die there.
Children say that people are hung sometimes for speaking the truth.
I was in my thirteenth year when I heard a voice from God to help me govern my conduct. And the first time I was very much afraid."
